Creating two recursive JavaScript functions:

fibonacci
 Creating a fibonacci recursive function, as opposed to a for loop, has the advantage of being able to access the previous results in a scoped array. Being able to access the last two numbers in the sequence means that we do not have to repeat calculations for all previous iterations each time we want a new number. This has a huge effect on the time take to calculate large fibonacci sequences.
